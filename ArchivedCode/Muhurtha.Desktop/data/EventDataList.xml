		<Description>
			Panchanga Suddhi. - We have already said that a Panchanga
			consists of tithi, vara, nakshatra. yoga and karana. All these must be
			auspicious. In regard to lunar days, the 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th and 14th, full
			and new moon days should be avoided. In regard to vara, Thursday and
			Friday are held to be suitable for all works. Tuesday, is to be generally
			avoided except when it happens to be the 10th, 12th or 16th day of the
			child's birth when the child's Namakarana (baptising or giving name)
			may be performed. Of the several Nakshatras, Bharani and Krittika
			should be avoided for all auspicious works as these two are said to be
			presided o ver by the god of death (Yama) and the god of fire (Agni) respectively. In urgent cases if the Lagna could be fortified, the dosha
			due to nakshatra may get neutralised. The last parts of Aslesha,
			Jyeshta and Revati should also be avoided. Coming to the Yoga (vide
			page 12) the 6th (Atiganda). 9th (Soola). 10th (Ganda), 17th (Vyatipata)
			and 27th (Vydhruti) have deleterious effects upon events which are
			started or commenced under them. - The Karana chosen must be
			appropriate to the election in view. Thus Bava is auspicious for starting
			works of permanent importance while Thaithula is propitious for
			marriage. Bhadra is unfit for any good work but is eminently suitable for
			violent and cruel deeds. For getting initiation into kshudra mantras
			Sakuni Havana is propitious.
			Therefore, Panchanga Suddhi means a good lunar day, a beneficial
			weekday, an auspicious constellation, a good yoga and a fertilising
			Karana.

			The 2nd great evil is Surya Sankramana or the
			solar ingress into different zodiacal signs. When the Sun is about to
			leave one sign and enter another there seem to occur certain
			disturbances in the organisation of the solar forces and such times are
			not recommended for any good work. On the contrary, they are held to
			be propitious for meditation, initiation into secret mantras and
			performance of certain religious rites which are held to purify not only
			the bodily electrical discharges but also the mental currents. Sixteen
			ghatis (6 hours 24 minutes) both before and after the entry of the Sun
			into a new sign should be rejected for all new works.

			Certain constellations, apart from their being harmonious or otherwise disposed
			with reference to one's own Janma Nakshatra, should be avoided for
			certain specific purposes on account of their inherent evil natures. In
			fact, Bharani is condemned for all good work and it has to be
			scrupulously avoided for all good work.

			When a constellation like
			Bharani(beta Arietis) is held to be constitutionally unfit for certain types
			of elections; it means that the vibrations emanating from it are
			destructive in character

			Of the several Nakshatras, Bharani and Krittika
			should be avoided for all auspicious works as these two are said to be
			presided over by the god of death (Yama) and the god of fire (Agni)
			respectively. In urgent cases if the Lagna could be fortified, the dosha
