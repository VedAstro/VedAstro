                To see how <strong>good or bad </strong> the life event is going to be. Look carefully at the summary row.
                The intensity of the <span style="color: red;font-weight: 900;">RED</span> or <span style="color: green;font-weight: 900;">GREEN</span> is different.
                When it is very <span style="color: darkred;font-weight: 900;">dark red</span> and no green lines around, it means that a very bad event will happen then.
                What exactly will happen will depend on your karma. What we can say <strong>for sure</strong>:- during red period a native
                will never say "I'm perfectly happy in life now". When it says red, something will be poking you. Maybe it is big, maybe small issue.
                But if the charts says it is there it will be there.

        <TextHTML>
            We use the aspect of "<strong>Mind</strong>" in astrology to make this chart. <strong>Why?</strong> because anything that effects your mind will make a difference to you.
            For instance we can make a chart to predict only "<strong>Weather</strong>" over your head, but if you live in the city and don't really care about rain or shine.
            Than what use is that complex chart to you. Most people will say the prediction is wrong. Of course it never effected the them, can't tell even if correct.

            We have seen to many cases to call this <strong>prediction lines</strong> a "coincidence".
            You will be aware of it. But when it says <span style="color: green;font-weight: 900;">GREEN</span>, than one can say it is <strong>impossible</strong> to have a worried mind or troubled heart.

            There are many recorded accounts of people through history dying peacefully in their sleep.
            Death will not be a tragedy to everybody, <strong>just not possible</strong>.
            It is only a transition date, to be afraid of it is like being afraid of your birthday. Life will not be fun that way, we have all tried it.
            And know very well what life without knowing tomorrows tragedy is like.
            Even death during <span style="color: green;font-weight: 900;">GREEN</span> period will be happy or peaceful and never tragic.
            Keep in mind this algorithm does "NOT" count <strong>death</strong> as a bad life event, it is <strong>how</strong> you die that is predicted to be good or bad.
            Some say, "I like not knowing". We say, "<strong>Good luck</strong>".

        <TextHTML>
            Since it is without doubt that we can predict when will a person smile or frown. Than it is possible to predict when a person
            will win the lottery. The "lottery prize" is different for every person. Not everybody wants money. Some people are very
            happy when they are with others. When lonely they are sad and dont't like it. For example, for this person we can accurately predict
            that when <span style="color: red;font-weight: 900;">RED</span> lines appear that this person will most likely be left alone,
            hence causing their <strong>lottery loss</strong>. Ergo we predict with confidence, that a person will win a <strong>real cash lottery</strong>
            if only money is equal to happiness to him. The fact is, most people want not just "cash", but also good Wife or Fame or Courier or Education
            for actual happiness. Hence also proving why most people don't win the lottery in real life.

    <Content>

        <h4 class="fw-bold">Purpose?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4">
            The vexed question of timing events is solved to a great
            extent by the Dasa system. From a scientific point of view,
            we cannot say with any sort of definiteness, upon what basis
            each planet is allotted a certain number of years as its term of Dasa.
            But in actual practice, the Dasa system yields very satisfactory result
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-bold">What Dasa system do you use?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4">
            There are any number of Dasas in general use,
            but we propose to deal with Vimshottari. In the
            choice of any particular type of Dasa, the criterion must be
            that of experience and Vimshottari has answered this test.
        </p>

        <h4 class="fw-bold">How to calculate?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify mb-4">
            The position of the Moon at birth is important in the
            calculation of the Dasas. Every constellation covers 13.3°
            degrees of the zodiacal space. Each nakshatra has a planet
            assigned as its lord and the Dasa at birth is determined rather
            indicated by the constellation occupied by the Moon at the
            moment of birth.
        </p>


        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item active" aria-current="true">Tips to read dasa</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                1. For instance
                political success may be predicted in the Dasa of the Sun, if
                he is in Aries in the 10th house. This political success will be
                at its maximum provided the Sun is not aspected by malefics
                and his position is equally strong in the Navamsa. If he is
                aspected by Saturn who may be in Aquarius, then in spite of
                the Sun being in Aries, complete political success cannot be
                and ought not to be predicted.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                2. The Dasa results stand to be modified by the effect of
                Gochara or transiting planets.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                3. If the lord is well placed as already explained above,
                be will do good regarding the house or houses with which he
                may have anything to do either by way of ownership or aspect
                or location during his period. while if the lord is weak and ill placed,
                he will inflict misery.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                4. The lord of the Dasa has a quality of his own stamped
                upon him. This will again be modified by the nature of the
                house, the nature of the sign, the nature of the aspecting
                bodies, the nature of the lord of the constellation the Dasa
                lord is in, the favourable and unfavourable situation of the
                lord of Dasa in the Navamsa
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                5. ln the course of a Dasa, a planet produces such results
                as it indicates by virtue of ownership, association, location
                and aspect. For instance, favourable position of the lord of
                the 2nd will give good income and wealth during his Dasa.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                6. The general effect of the Dasa (major period) get
                modified by the planet that rules the particular Bhukti (sub-period).
                In such a case, however, the influences of both the
                planets are to be compounded and the relation between them
                taken into account
