    <h2>About : reason and goal for this project</h2>
    <p>
        Anybody who has studied Vedic Astrology knows well how accurate it can be. But also how complex it can get to make accurate predictions. It takes decades of experience to be able make accurate prediction. As such this knowledge only reaches a limited people. This project is an effort to change that.
        Our goal is to make Vedic Astrology easily accessible to anybody. So that people can use it in their daily lives for their benefit. Vedic Astrology in Sanskrit mean "Light". And that is exactly what it is. It lights our future so we can change it. And it lights our past, to understand our mistakes.
        By using modern computational technologies & methods we can simplify the complexity of Vedic Astrology. For example, calculating planet strength (Bhava Bala) used to take hours, now with computers we can calculate it in milliseconds. And using databases & innovative programming methods, there is no need to remember thousands of planetary combinations, allowing you to make accurate predictions with little to no knowledge.

            <h4>House 2</h4>
            <p>
                The second house signifies, family, speech, vision and
                financial prosperity.The several yogas—good
                and bad—formed by the second lord or in the second house
                will produce their own effects. These considerations hold
                good in the Navamsa also. In short the second house
                largely but not exclusively indicates wealth.

                The third house rules brothers, sisters and relatives in
                general. It has governance over courage. The third is also
                concerned with throat, ears and father's death. In regard to
                brothers and sisters, the reference is generally to younger
                ones, i.e., those born after the native.

            <h4>House 4</h4>
            <p>
                The fourth has reference to mother, immovable
                property, education, vehicles and general happiness. It
                follows as a matter of course that an affliction to the fourth
                house may result in the shape of depriving the person of
                peace of mind, causing misfortune to his mother, troubles
                in regard to property affairs and so on. But in reality, a
                person may be educated but may also lose his mother early.
                He may command good immovable properties but may not
                be happy. Of the various yogas present in the horoscope,
                those that have a bearing on the fourth house should be carefully noted.
                We shall first consider the general combinations and
                then the effects of planets severally. The fourth, like the
                tenth, is a very important house and is in fact the pivot
                around which revolve some of the special events affecting
                the individual's life.

            <h4>House 5</h4>
            <p>
                The fifth house refers to children, emotions and
                feelings, faith in God and past birth good (Poorvapunya).
                To a certain extent it is also concerned with speculative tendencies.
                The remarks made in para 2 of page 159 pertaining to the fourth
                house apply with equal force to the fifth house also.

            <h4>House 6</h4>
            <p>
                The sixth house rules or signifies accidents, diseases,
                enemies, mental affliction, mother's brother and
                misfortunes. An affliction to the sixth house may result in
                the shape of the person suffering diseases or incurring debts
                or enemies. In reality however a person may be suffering
                from diseases, but be free from debts or he may be
                perfectly healthy but involved in huge debts. The difficulty
                arises in differentiating the different events comprehended
                by a single house.Planets involved in aspect-ing the house
                and the lord are also important. Several arishta yogas
                having a bearing on the sixth house should be carefully
                studied.

            <h4>House 7</h4>
            <p>
                The 7th house mainly refers to marriage, wife or husband
                and marital happiness. Karaka, who in this case would be Venus.
                There are the secondary considerations also, viz , the occupants
                of the 7th house and the planets associating with the 7th lord.

            <h4>House 8</h4>
            <p>
                The 8th House deals with longevity, legacies, gifts and
                unearned wealth, nature of death, disgrace, degradation and
                details pertaining to death.The yogas formed in
                the 8th house will produce their own effects. The same
                considerations must be judged from the Navamsa chart also.
                Although there are several significations to the eighth house, we
                will focus our attention on the source and nature, time and place
                of death.

            <p>
                The ninth house, although it denotes several significations, is
                primarily concerned with father and long distance travel.
                The ninth house signifies father, righteousness, preceptor,
                grand-children, intuition, religion, sympathy, fame, charities,
                leadership, long journeys and communication with spirits.
                The Sun is the karaka for father. Yogas formed in the 9th house or
                involving the 9th lord produce their own results. These
                considerations must be judged from the Navamsa chart also.

            <h4>House 10</h4>
            <p>
                The tenth house refers to occupation, profession, temporal
                honours, foreign travels, self-respect, knowledge and dignity and

            <h4>House 11</h4>
            <p>
                The eleventh house refers to gains, elder brother, friends,
                acquisitions, freedom from misery, and happy tidings. An
                affliction to the 11th house may result in the loss of brother,
                friends, loss of wealth, misery or unhappy news. The exact
                nature of the result can be gleaned only after an assessment of
                the whole chart and the afflicting planets. To some extent the
                eleventh also concerns marriage.
